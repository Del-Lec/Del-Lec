# 💫 About Me :

🌱 Hello everyone ! Welcome🌱
<br><br>
My name is Delphine, and I'm currently working on an exciting personal project: <br>
[HRVantage](https://github.com/DelphineLecorney/HRVantage), a human resources management platform built with Laravel in PHP.

HRVantage aims to simplify human resources management for businesses, covering employee management, jobs, benefits and much more. 

I'm building this platform from the ground up, constantly updating and improving its functionality. 
If you'd like to find out more or even collaborate on HR-related issues, I'm open to new opportunities and rewarding discussions.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you'd like to find out more about the project or if you have any ideas to share.


I'm passionate about IT development and creating innovative solutions, and I'm delighted to share with you a glimpse of my background and projects.

I've had the opportunity to work on a number of exciting projects, which you can find in my GitHub repository. Each of these projects represents a unique challenge that I've enthusiastically taken on, using a variety of programming languages and tools. Whether it's web applications, practical scripts or even project contributions, I've sought to constantly improve my skills.

I'm currently looking for a challenging internship. I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and I'm convinced that an internship would be the ideal opportunity for me to acquire new knowledge and apply my skills in a professional environment.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my GitHub profile. I look forward to collaborating with creative minds.

🔭 Sincerely, Delphine 🔭
